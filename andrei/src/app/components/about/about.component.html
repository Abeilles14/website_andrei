            I'm a 4th year student studying Electrical Engineering
            at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
            I have a passion for software development, robotics,
            mountain running, and learning new random skills.

        <p style="font-size:18px">
            I have always been fascinated by the combination of software, robotics,
            and AI, and enjoy learning hardware concepts in class while exploring various
            software applications in personal projects and design teams in order to
            become a well-rounded engineer that would be of use in a versatile environmnent.
            <br><br>
            Being an avid hiker and mountain runner, I travel and compete in multiple mountain
            obstacle races around the world. I enjoy exploring new technologies and software
            projects as well as paint digital art, practice on my violin, or train in martial arts.
            Occasionally, i sleep.
