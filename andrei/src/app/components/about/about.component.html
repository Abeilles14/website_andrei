                I'm a 3rd year student studying Electrical Engineering
                at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
                I have a passion for software development, embedded programming,
                mountain running, and learning new random skills.

                I have always been fascinated by the combination of software, robotics,
                and AI, and enjoy learning hardware concepts in class while exploring various
                software applications in personal projects and design teams in order to
                become a well-rounded engineer that would be of use in a versatile environmnent.

                <br>
                Being an avid hiker and mountain runner, I travel and compete in multiple mountain
                obstacle races around the world. I enjoy exploring new technologies and programming
                languages as well as paint some digital art or fiddle around on my electrical violin.
                Occasionally, i even sleep.
