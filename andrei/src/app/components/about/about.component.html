            I am an BASc Electrical Engineering graduate from the 
            University of British Columbia and a part-time MS ECE student at Purdue University, 
            working as a Silicon Engineer at Microsoft in Mountain View. I enjoy digital design, robotics, and learning new random skills.

            Integrating software, microcontrollers, and electronics into robotics applications is one of my 
            many hobbies. Some things have caught on fire in the past, but I have yet to burn my house down and so 
            the hobby continues. 
            <br><br>
            Sometimes I tinker with 3d printers and drones too. They always seem to break at the most 
            important times so 90% of the time is spent maintaining, verbally abusing, and fixing them.
            <br><br>
            Being a fan of hiking and trail running, I like to travel around the world capturing photographies of 
            the outdoors. I enjoy exploring new technologies and software projects as well as training in martial arts and Chinese Lion Dancing.
            Occasionally, I sleep.
