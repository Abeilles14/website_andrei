            I am a 4th year student studying Electrical Engineering
            at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
            I have a passion for software development, robotics,
            hiking, and learning new random skills.

            Integrating software, microcontrollers, and electronics into robotics applications is one of my 
            many hobbies. Some things have caught on fire in the past, but I have yet to burn my house down and so 
            the hobby continues. Sometimes I tinker with 3d printers too. They always seem to break at the most 
            important times so 90% of the time is spent maintaining, verbally abusing, and fixing them.
            I enjoy combining hardware and software concepts in engineering design team activities 
            and personal projects in order to become a well-rounded engineer that can tackle any challenges.
            <br><br>
            Being a fan of hiking and trail running, I like to travel around the world capturing photographies of 
            the outdoors. I enjoy exploring new technologies and software projects as well as creating digital art or 
            training in martial arts.
            Occasionally, I sleep.
